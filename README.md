# Metal-detector-game
This project was completed during the Spring 2022 semester at UIC. This was made with p5.js using Javascript. The goal was to create an interactive game and demonstrate my ability to code an animated background. I animated the water using gradients and implemented a system where the sand generated a unique pattern each time the game launched. A similar randomization method was used for treasure placement. Originally, I planned for the program to play a sound when the player approached the treasure instead of displaying a visible mound, but due to time constraints, I couldn't implement that feature.
